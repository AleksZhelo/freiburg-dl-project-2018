task 2:
+ submit plotting scripts to the repo (also add axis labels and a legend) (Matthias)
+ scatter plots as in Stefan's point 1 (Alex)
+ box plots from point 2 (Alex)
+ prepare results table and export to LaTeX (add exp decay results too) (Alex)

task 3:
+ try Frank's idea and report the results (table entry) (Alex)

+ prepare some extrapolation (to step 100) plots (Alex)
  tile of four plots selected by most interesting (some work, some don't)

+ extrapolation from 5, 10, 20, 30 to 40 - same tile of four
  each for their own models

+ add DeCov scatter plots? (Alex)

+ prepare hyperparam optimization results table and export to LaTeX (Alex)

+- boxplot - report results predicting from first 10 points
  best curve baseline, best fixed baseline, two best (Al. and Mat.) trained on random
  and two best (same) trained on 10 steps
  send the errors to Mat. (Alex)
  plot the thing (Mat.)
