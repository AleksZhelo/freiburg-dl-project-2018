questions on task 3 (LSTM)
- predict step 40 or predict step by step?
- which baseline to use? -> no RNN, idea: scikit-learn cheatsheet, random forest, svr, knn
- randomized fixed length or different for each sequence?
- "whole training data" in a 3-fold CV or everything?

ideas / remarks
- for Dense layer in task 3 try sth. else than sigmoid activation
- regularization for RNN

hidden state for RNN
- idea by Frank: have MLP in the beginning to initialise hidden state

HPO: BO, SMAC, successive halving
